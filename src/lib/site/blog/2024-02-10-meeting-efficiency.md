  Meetings are a necessary part of team collaboration, but they don't have to be time-wasters. Learn how to make your team meetings both efficient and effective.

  ## Before the Meeting

  1. **Clear Agenda**
     - Define specific objectives
     - Share materials in advance
     - Set time limits for each topic

  2. **Right Participants**
     - Invite only necessary team members
     - Assign roles (facilitator, note-taker)
     - Consider time zones for remote teams

  ## During the Meeting

  ### Keep Engagement High
  - Start on time
  - Encourage participation
  - Park off-topic discussions
  - Document decisions and action items

  ### Time Management
  - Use timeboxing
  - Take short breaks in longer meetings
  - End on time (or early!)

  Remember: A well-run meeting energizes the team and moves projects forward. A poorly run meeting does the opposite.
